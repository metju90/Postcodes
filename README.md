  ## Problem definition

In Switzerland, the names of the locations we write next to the postcode are not exactly the names of the municipality to which the address belongs.

Consider the following examples:

- 69.8% of the addresses `8806 Bäch SZ` belongs to the municipality Freienbach;
- the remaining 30.2% addresses of `8806 Bäch SZ`belongs to the municipality Wollerau.

Additionally,

- 100% of the addresses in `6343 Buonas` belongs to the municipality Risch;
- 100% of the addresses in `6343 Rotkreuz` belongs to the municipality Risch;
- 100% of the addresses in `6343 Risch` also belongs to the municipality Risch.


This application

This application expects the user to input a postcode and then the system and the system list the corresponding locations and municipalities.

Using the postcodes mentioned above as an example, if the user inserts `8806` postcode, `Bäch SZ` and a dropdown with options `Freienbach` and `Wollerau` will be displayed in the `location` and `municipalities` respectively.
